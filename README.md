Project: Recipes

In this project, I will be putting my HTML knowledge into practice by creating a simple website showcasing various different recipes.

Some of the skills I've learnt and would be implementing in this project are:
- Creating a new Git repository
- Cloning the repo onto my local machine
- Making directories and files through CLI
- Writing a boilerplate HTML from scratch
- Implementing elements for headings, paragraphs, ordered & unordered lists, anchors, and their subsequent attributes
- Using absolute and relative links
